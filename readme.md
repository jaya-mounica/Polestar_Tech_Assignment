# Playwright (TS binding) + Cucumber (BDD)
For Polestar Project created Test Cases using Cucumber approach(BDD) with POM Design Pattern in TypeScript

## Features
- Cucumber Approach
- Page object model
- Parallel Execution
- Reading data from json / enum files
- Getting Environment deatils from .env file
- Sample report


## Project structure
.github -> yml file to execute the tests in GitHub Actions
src -> Contains all the features & Typescript code
test-results -> Contains all the reports related file

## Reports
- Default Cucumber report
- Logs
- Screenshots of failure

Get Started
Setup:
- Clone or download the project
- Extract and open in the VS-Code
- npm i to install the dependencies
- npx playwright install to install the browsers
- npm run test to execute the tests
To run a particular test change
  
  ```
  paths : [
            "src/test/feature/"
         ]             
Use tags to run a specific or collection of specs
